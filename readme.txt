Chances are, you have selected 'views' in 'Order by number of:' block in the widget settings. Since the plugin did not collect the necessary data yet, there is nothing to be displayed. Once the users start visiting your pages, the plugin will keep track, and based on the received statistics, the posts will be displayed in the widget in the frontend.
